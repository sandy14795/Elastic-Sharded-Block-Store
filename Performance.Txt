Case
1. Unalligned Write vs Alligned Write
2. Unalligned Read vs Alligned Read

In Both of these case you have to run Single client and Multi client with Different Addr
:- The Reason for this evalutation is to find the maximum Bandwidth in Both the Cases

Case 
1. Replicated Write vs Replicated Write
2. Replicated Read vs Replicated Read

In Both of these case you have to run Single client and Multi client with Different Addr

Case: Worst Senerio Same Addr Multi Client
Muliple client Avg write performance vs Single client write performance 
Same addr (I have written both of these cases check MultiConsistancy.cc and Consistancy.cc : Just need to collect time)
